<p>Beyond our extensive range of offered courses, APSY possesses
	five research labs dedicated to educational and research purposes.
	These facilities and equipment provide faculty members and students
	with the opportunity to gain experience working with the most modern
	research tools currently available, in pursuit of our goals of further
	the development of psychological science, and of equal or even greater
	importance, the furthering of the training and education of our
	students.</p>
<h3>1) Counseling Training and Behavioral Observation Laboratory
	(Location: C112)</h3>
<p>This facility is dedicated to the study of infant development,
	and the training of our future counseling and clinical psychologists.
	This lab is primarily used for simulated individual and family
	counseling, and contains a wide range of equipment appropriate for use
	in Free Play, Art Play and Sand Tray therapy. Closed circuit recording
	cameras permit audiovisual recording of all training and counseling
	activities and the lab is excellently equipped for use in data
	collection in support of lifespan (particularly child) development
	research as well.</p>

<h3>2) Sensation and Perception Laboratory(Location: C113)</h3>
<p>Dedicated to the study of Psychophysics, this lab is equipped
	with modern equipment used in the study of relative sensitivity
	thresholds, sensory receptor density mapping, signal detection theory,
	and multicolor preference and shape constancy testing.</p>
