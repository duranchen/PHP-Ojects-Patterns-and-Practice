<p>Over the past 25 years, scientific psychology has experienced
	tremendous growth and development throughout China. In 1989, there were
	five universities possessing psychology departments. By 2007, this
	number had increased to almost 200 private and public institutions
	dedicated to the scientific study of human cognition and behavior.
	Today, approximately 10,000 students are enrolled in B.A.-level
	psychology programs throughout China. In addition, there are over 2,000
	students enrolled in M.A.- and M.S.-level programs, and more than 300
	others enrolled in Ph.D.-level psychology programs. All of this
	reflects the rapid and extensive development of psychological science
	to be found in China today. This burgeoning growth is reflected and
	fueled by the federal government¡¯s recent decision to include
	psychology as one of six areas of science to receive prioritized
	funding.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, China¡¯s economy and society have
	undergone rapid and extensive development and change. This has greatly
	increased her need for an increased number of professional
	psychologists. For example, there are less than 10,000 psychologists
	working in China today, yet there are more than 1,000,000 vacancies in
	the field. As China continues her advance into the 21st century, this
	critical need for psychology professionals will only grow at a very
	rapid rate.</p>

<p>The field of psychology encompasses both research, through which
	we learn fundamental things about human and nonhuman animal behavior,
	and practice, though which the knowledge is applied to solving problems
	and prompting healthy human development (see above chart). A large part
	of our UIC Applied Psychology graduates are primarily working as
	practitioners. In current China, many areas are in great need of this
	kind of psychological professionals, such as clinical psychologists,
	counseling psychologists, developmental psychologists, community
	psychologists, Industrial/organizational psychologists and so on.</p>
